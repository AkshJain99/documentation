Introduction
=============

Grok is a project to give sane, easy to use, API to Zope 3 systems.
It exists as standalone, but Plone compatible port five.grok is available for Plone 3.3 and onwards.

Benefits over using pure Zope 3 APIs

* No ZCML files or XML sit-ups needed (except bootstrapping one configure.zcml file)

* More things are automatic and less explicit hand-written code needed. E.g. template file and view class are automatically matched.

* Less code generation

Grok will automatically scan all .py files in your product and
run registration code in them. This way you can use Python decorators
and magical classes to perform tasks which before needed to have
hand written registration code.

Using Grok in your package
===========================

configure.zcml - register your package for grokking
------------------------------------------------------

To enable grok'ing for your package:

* The top-level ``configure.zcml`` must include the ``grok`` namespace and
  the ``grok:grok`` directive. You do not need to put
  this directive subpackages. This directive scans your package source tree
  recursively for grok'ed files.

* The package must be loaded using ``setup.py`` auto-include, NOT using a
  ``zcml =`` section in ``buildout.cfg``.
  Otherwise templates are not loaded.

* Optionally, add ``templates`` and ``static`` folders to your package root.

* You still need to include subpackages for old-fashioned :term:`ZCML`
  configurations.

Example

.. code-block:: xml

    <configure
        xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
        xmlns:five="http://namespaces.zope.org/five"
        xmlns:cmf="http://namespaces.zope.org/cmf"
        xmlns:i18n="http://namespaces.zope.org/i18n"
        xmlns:grok="http://namespaces.zope.org/grok"
        i18n_domain="plonetheme.xxx">

      <include package="five.grok" />

      <five:registerPackage package="." initialize=".initialize" />

      <!-- Grok the package to initialise schema interfaces and content classes -->
      <grok:grok package="." />

      <include package=".browser" />

    </configure>

If you are using components from other packages you might also want to add

.. code-block:: xml

    <includeDependencies package="." />

This makes the ``configure.zcml`` and thus Python code
of all modules listed in ``setup.py`` *install_requires*
section is loaded before your module is being processed.

setup.py - include five.grok package dependency for download
--------------------------------------------------------------

You still need to get ``five.grok`` package to your buildout.

Edit your Python egg ``setup.py`` file and list ``five.grok`` as dependency::

    install_requires = ["five.grok", ...],

Re-run buildout. Now buildout should download ``five.grok`` for PyPi and activate it for you.

If you are using Plone 4.1 or older you also need `Dexterity extends = line pindowns in your buildout <https://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/how-to/install>`_.
Otherwise you may get *Version Conflict* errors when running buildout.

Plone 4.3 migration and five.grok dependency
=======================================================

Please see `Plone 4.2 -> 4.3 Dexterity upgrade guide <https://plone.org/documentation/manual/upgrade-guide/version/upgrading-plone-4.2-to-4.3/dexterity-optional-extras>`_ first.

Migrating Dexterity and z3c.forms to Plone 4.3
--------------------------------------------------

Plone 4.3 ships with Dexterity. ``five.grok`` is a huge dependency with a lot of
code of which maintenance cannot be guaranteed in the future (`See grok.zope.org <http://grok.zope.org>`_,
`discussion <http://plone.293351.n2.nabble.com/The-grokless-madness-and-unable-to-create-a-simple-form-tp7564179p7564184.html>`_).
Because Plone community cannot commit to maintain this code, but we still want to use the best goodies
of grok based development, some compromises was made for Plone 4.3 regarding grok style forms and directives.

* You can include ``five.grok`` as a dependency, as you have done this far, but it is not going to be
  in Plone default installation in foreseeable future. Please see migration notes.

* ``grok()`` declarations, like ``grok.name()`` in classes are not supported by Plone 4.3 out of the box

* ``plone.directives.form`` goodies distributed to two supported packages: ``plone.supermodel`` and
  ``plone.autoform``

To make your code Plone 4.3 compatible, grokless way do imports as following::

    import z3c.form.form

    from plone.supermodel import model
    from plone.autoform import directives as form
    from plone.autoform.form import AutoExtensibleForm

And you can use them like::

    class IChoiceExamples(model.Schema):
        """ Single choice and multiple choice examples """

        form.widget(multiChoiceCheckbox=CheckBoxFieldWidget)
        multiChoiceCheckbox = zope.schema.List(
            title=u"Checkbox multiple choices",
            ...)


    # Different form base classes are provided:
    # XXX: Fill in here what you should use with Dexterity content types
    class ChoiceExamples(AutoExtensibleForm, z3c.form.form.Form):
        """
        """
        schema = IChoiceExamples

Migrating views from five.grok to plain Plone
------------------------------------------------

If you further want to break the dependency with ``five.grok``
and get rid of ``grok.xxx()`` directives in your classes
here are further dependency.

Remove ``five.grok`` from the dependency list of your egg and remove ``<grok:grok>`` ZCML directive in ``configure.zcml``.

Remove ``from five import grok`` in all of your package modules.

Manually :doc:`register static media folder of your egg </adapt-and-extend/theming/templates_css/resourcefolders>`

Declare views and forms using :doc:`configure.zcml </develop/plone/views/browserviews.html#creating-a-view-using-zcml>`

Remove ``grok.templatedir()`` and map view classes to templates using ``<browser:page>`` ZCML directive.

Grok migration source example::

    class Demos(grok.View):
        """ Render all demo forms with their widgets in a nice view.

        Read forms which implements IWidgetDemo marke via @widget_demo
        class decocator. Build a nice and useful description string
        for each field in those forms.

        """

        grok.context(ISiteRoot)
        grok.name("widgets-demo")


ZCML migration ``configuration.zcml`` target example::

    <configure
        xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
        xmlns:five="http://namespaces.zope.org/five"
        xmlns:cmf="http://namespaces.zope.org/cmf"
        xmlns:i18n="http://namespaces.zope.org/i18n"
        xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser"
        i18n_domain="plone.app.widgets">

      <browser:page
          name="widgets-demo"
          for="Products.CMFCore.interfaces.ISiteRoot"
          class=".demo.Demos"
          permission="zope2.View"
          template="widgets-demo.pt"
          />

    </configure>

.. note ::

    Forms handle ``update()`` themselves - this concerns only non-form views

If your view has ``update()`` method you need to call it manually in ``__call__()``
because ``BrowserView`` base class doesn't do this.

    class MyView(BrowserView):

        def update(self):
            ...

        def __call__(self):
            self.update()
            return self.index()  # Or self.render() for grok.CodeView


Grok static media folder
=========================

Learn more about :doc:`Resource directories </develop/adapt-and-extend/theming/temaplates_css/resourcefolder>`.

.. warning:: Since five.grok 1.3.0 this method does not work.

The easiest way to manage static resources is to make use of the static resource directory feature in five.grok.
Simply add a directory called static in the package and make sure that the ``<grok:grok package="." />``
line appears in configure.zcml.

Example how to include ``yourproduct.app/static`` folder as ``++resource++yourproduct.app`` URL.

.. code-block:: xml

        <configure
            ...
            xmlns:grok="http://namespaces.zope.org/grok">

          <grok:grok package="." />

        </configure>

If a ``static`` resource directory in the ``example.conference`` package contains a file called ``conference.css``,
it will be accessible on a URL like ``http://<server>/site/++resource++example.conference/conference.css``.
The resource name is the same as the package name wherein the static directory appears.



Subscribing using the ``grok`` API
-----------------------------------------

.. note::

    Since the release of Plone 4, this (grok) method is simpler.

Example subscription which subscribes a content type to add and edit events::

    from five import grok
    from Products.Archetypes.interfaces import IObjectEditedEvent
    from Products.Archetypes.interfaces import IObjectInitializedEvent

    class ORAResearcher(folder.ATFolder, orabase.ORABase, ResearcherMixin):
        """A Researcher synchronized from ORA.
        """
        implements(IORAResearcher, IResearcher)

        meta_type = "ORAResearcher"
        schema = ORAResearcherSchema

        # Callbacks for both add and edit events

        @grok.subscribe(ORAResearcher, IObjectEditedEvent)
        def object_edited(context, event):
            orabase.object_edited(context, event)

        @grok.subscribe(ORAResearcher, IObjectInitializedEvent)
        def object_added(context, event):
            orabase.object_added(context, event)


Example subscription which subscribes events without context::

        # Really old stuff
        from ZPublisher.interfaces import IPubStart

        # Modern stuff
        from five import grok

        @grok.subscribe(IPubStart)
        def check_redirect(e):
            """ Check if we have a custom redirect script in Zope
            application server root.
            """

Creating a viewlet using Grok
==================================

:doc:`Grok framework </appendices/grok>` allows you to register a viewlet easily using Python directives.

It is recommended that you use :doc:`Dexterity ZopeSkel add-on product code skeleton </develop/addons/paste>`
where you add this code.

Create *yourcomponent.app/yourcomponent/app/browser/viewlets.py*::

        """

            Viewlets related to application logic.

        """

        # Zope imports
        from Acquisition import aq_inner
        from zope.interface import Interface
        from five import grok
        from zope.component import getMultiAdapter

        # Plone imports
        from plone.app.layout.viewlets.interfaces import IHtmlHead

        from yourcompany.app.behavior.lsmintegration import ISomeDexterityBehavior

        # The viewlets in this file are rendered on every content item type
        grok.context(Interface)

        # Use templates directory to search for templates.
        grok.templatedir('templates')

        class JavascriptSnippet(grok.Viewlet):
            """ A viewlet which will include some custom code in <head> if the condition is met """

            grok.viewletmanager(IHtmlHead)

            def available(self):
                """ Check if we are in a specific content type.

                Check that the Dexterity content type has a certain
                behavior set on it through Dexterity settings panel.
                """
                try:
                    avail = ISomeDexterityBehavior(self.context)
                except TypeError:
                    return False

                return True


Then create folder ``yourcomponent.app/yourcomponent/app/browser/templates`` where you add the related ``javascripthead.pt``:

.. code-block:: html

        <tal:extra-head omit-tag="" condition="viewlet/available">
                <meta name="something" content="your custom meta">
        </tal:extra-head>

Creating a viewlet manager: Grok way
============================================

Recommended if you want to keep the number of files and lines of XML and Python to a minimum.

An example here for related Python code::
