In Plone 5, an auto-generated Welcome! section is created on a root splash page if it’s short name is, “front-page”. Two ways to remove this section include:

#. Upon saving this new page, you can then press “Display” from the toolbar and select “Change content item as default view…”
#. Finally select the radio button of your new page and press Save.

2. Duplicating theme and removing line of code
----------------------------------------------

#. Go to site setup
#. Press, “Theming”
#. Press, “Copy” on the Barceloneta theme, give it any short title and description and you  can activate it now or later. Press Create.
#. Click on, “rules.xml” to open this file in the browser.
#. Find and delete the line that says:
  <after css:theme="#mainnavigation-wrapper" css:content=".principal" href="/@@hero" css:if-content="body.template-document_view.section-front-page" />
Then to finish up...

#. Press the blue, Save button, then press, “Back to control panel”.
#. If you’ve not already activated your new theme, press “Activate”, then “Clear Cache” on your new theme.
