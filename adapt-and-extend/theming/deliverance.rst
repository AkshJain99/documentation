What is Deliverance
--------------------

Deliverance moves items from your Plone site into placeholders in your theme, without touching the Plone site or the theme.

Deliverance is a universal tool to theme HTML, applying a consistent style to applications and static files regardless of how they are implemented and with what technology.

Deliverance extracts pieces of content from your Plone site generated output and puts those into named placeholders in the theme's resulting template.

This is accomplished without touching the Plone site or the theme that is used within the Plone itself.

Some of the benefits:

-  A designer can create a Plone theme without any specific knowledge of
   Plone's specific technology
-  A single theme can apply to multiple back-end web applications
   regardless of what platform they were developed for
