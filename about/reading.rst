Reading the documentation
=========================

Online
=======

The easiest way to read this documentation is online at http://docs.plone.org

There is also build in support for `opensearch <http://www.opensearch.org/Home>`_ that means you can search http://docs.plone.org right away from your browser bar, if your bowser supports that.

`This video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9gkjO_Xvxs>`_ shows an example on how to add http://docs.plone.org to Firefox.
