msgid "**Worried about security?** As an open source product, a large number of developers frequently scrutinize the code for any potential security issues. This proactive approach is better than the wait-and-see approach in proprietary software that relies on keeping security issues a secret instead of resolving them outright. Based on Python and the Zope libraries, Plone has a technological edge that has has helped it attain the best security track record of any major CMS (Source: `CVE <http://cve.mitre.org/>`_). In fact, security is a major reason why many CMS users are switching to Plone."

msgid "The market is full of open source content management systems, so it is important to do your homework before choosing one for your organization. Remember that a simple CMS may work out great to start with, but lead to problems with scaling or migration when you need more capability than it can provide. At the other end of the spectrum, a powerful CMS can be so difficult to learn and maintain that it never gains acceptance to users. Make sure the CMS you choose meets your needs today without compromising future growth. We hope you'll take the time to learn more about Plone and what it can do for you. We've created this site specifically as a gateway to information on how to get started with Plone, as well as information on development, solutions providers, events, news, and the wealth of product add-ons created by the community."
