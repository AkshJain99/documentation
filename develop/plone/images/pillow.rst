Pillow (PIL Fork)
=================

Plone uses internally Pillow a fork of PIL (Python Imaging Library)
for low level image manipulation and decoding.

`Pillow <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow>`_ was created to offer better multi-OS installation support. Specifically it offers:

- Setuptools compatibility
- Hosting (and mirroring) by PyPI (vs. off site)
- Windows eggs
- Bug fixes (many of which simply add vendor-specific library directories to the compiler's search path.)
